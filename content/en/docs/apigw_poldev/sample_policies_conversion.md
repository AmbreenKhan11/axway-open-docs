The conversion sample policy takes a REST-style request and converts it into a SOAP call. This topic describes the **REST to SOAP**
policy, and explains how to run this sample.

REST to SOAP policy
-------------------

The **REST to SOAP**
policy is as follows:

![Conversion policy](/Images/docbook/images/samples/conversion_sample_policy.gif)

The **REST to SOAP**
policy performs the following tasks:

1.  Extracts the information from the request (a message attribute is created for each query string and/or HTTP header).
2.  Creates a SOAP message using the **Set Message**
    filter.
3.  Sends the request to the `StockQuote`
    demo service.
4.  Extracts the value of the stock from the response using XPath.
5.  Creates a plain text response.
6.  Sets the HTTP status code to 200.
