## What is the AMPLIFY Catalog?
The AMPLIFY Catalog provides a registry of all endpoints belonging to an organization. Examples of endpoints are APIs, MFT flows, SOAP, or gRPC, and they can be in different environments such as in the cloud, on-premise, within a microservice mesh, or at the edge (DMZ) of an organization. AMPLIFY Catalog allows developers to quickly discover and understand the endpoints and protocols that they can use to integrate quickly with your services. It simplifies access and increases the speed of building, integrating and deploying new services and apps.  Platform administrators can limit content access to specific users or teams and [manage subscriptions](/docs/central/catalog_subscriptions).
