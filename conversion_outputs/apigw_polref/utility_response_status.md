Overview
--------

The **Set Response Status**
filter is used to explicitly set the response status of a call. This status is then recorded as a message metric for use in reporting.

This filter is primarily used in cases where the fault handler for a policy is a **Policy Shortcut**
filter. If the **Policy Shortcut**
passes, the overall `fail`
status still exists. You can use the **Set Response Status**
filter to explicitly set the response status back to `pass`, if necessary.

See also [*Policy shortcut* on page 1](utility_policy_shortcut.htm).
