Overview
--------

The **Set Web Service Context**
filter is used in a policy to determine the service to obtain resources from in the web service repository.

For example, by pointing this filter at a preconfigured `getQuote`
service in the web service repository, the policy knows to return the WSDL for this particular service when a WSDL request is received. The **Return WSDL**
filter is used in conjunction with this filter to achieve this.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}The **Set Web Service Context**
filter is configured automatically when auto-generating a policy from a WSDL file and is not normally manually configured. For a detailed example, see
[Manage web services](/csh?context=638&product=prod-api-gateway-77)
in the
[API Gateway Policy Developer Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/)

Service WSDL settings
---------------------

The **Service WSDL**
tab enables you to select the web service to obtain resources from in the web service repository.

Click the browse button to select a service definition (WSDL file) currently registered in the web service repository from the tree. To register a web service, right-click the default **APIs** > **Web Services**
node, and select **Register Web Service**.

For more details on adding services to the web service repository, see
[Manage web services](/csh?context=638&product=prod-api-gateway-77)
