You can schedule API Gateway Analytics reports to run on a regular basis, and to email the results to users in PDF format. These reports include summary values at the top (for example, the number of requests, SLA breaches, alerts triggered, and unique clients in a specified week) followed by a table of services, and their aggregated usage data (for example, the number of requests on each service).

The report data is for the configured *current week of the report*, which is compared to the week before. You can set the configured *current week of the report*
to be the actual current calendar week or any prior week (provided there is corresponding data in the database).

To configure scheduled report settings in Policy Studio, right-click the **Environment Configuration** > **Listeners**
> **Axway Analytics**
node in the Policy Studio tree, and select **Database Archive**.

## Database configuration

Click the browse button the right, and select a pre-configured database connection in the dialog. This setting defaults to the `Default Database Connection`. To add a new database connection, right-click the **Database Connections**
node, and select **Add DB connection**.

You can also edit or delete existing nodes by right-clicking and selecting the appropriate option. Alternatively, you can add database connections under the **Environment Configuration** > **External Connections**
node in the Policy Studio tree view. For more details on creating database connections, see the
[API Gateway Policy Developer Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/)
.

## Scheduled reports configuration

You can configure the following settings for scheduled reports:

**Enable Report Generation**:\
Select whether to enable scheduled reports in PDF format. When selected, by default, this runs a scheduled weekly report on Monday morning at 0:01. For details on configuring a different time schedule, see the next setting. This setting is not selected by default.

When **Enable Report Generation**
is enabled, you can configure the following settings on the **Report Generator Process**
tab:

**Connect to API Gateway Analytics as User**:\

script.

**Output**:\
Enter the directory used for the generated report files in the **Output Directory**
field, or click **Choose**
to browse to the directory. Defaults to the directory entered using the `configureserver`
script (for example, `c:\temp\reports`). You can also select to **Do not delete report files after emailing**. This setting is not selected by default.

## SMTP configuration

When **Enable Report Generation**
is enabled, you can configure the following settings on the **SMTP**
tab. These settings default to those entered using the `configureserver`
script. For more details, see the

Select whether to keep generated PDF report files after they are sent. Not selected by default.
