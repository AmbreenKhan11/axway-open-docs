## What is the AMPLIFY Catalog?
The AMPLIFY Catalog provides a common view of all endpoints belonging to an organization. Alongside API interfaces, you'll have Managed File Transfer, business-to-business connectors that move data across your enterprise and outside its boundaries, and they can be in different environments such as in the cloud, on-premise , within a microservice mesh, or at the edge (DMZ) of the organization. AMPLIFY Catalog allows developers to quickly discover and understand the endpoints and protocols that they can use to integrate quickly with your services. It simplifies access and increases the speed of building, integrating and deploying new services and apps. Platform administrators can limit content access to specific users or teams and [manage subscriptions](/docs/central/catalog_subscriptions).
