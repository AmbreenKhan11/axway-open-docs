A Key Property Store (KPS) is an external data store of API Gateway policy properties, which is typically read frequently, and seldom written to. Using a KPS enables metadata-driven policies, whereby policy configuration is stored in an external data store, and looked up dynamically when policies are executed.

For more information on KPS, see the
[API Gateway Policy Developer Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/)
and also the
[API Gateway Key Property Store User Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_KPSUserGuide_allOS_en_HTML5)
