The **Connection**
filter makes the connection to the remote web service. It relies on connection details that are set by the other filters in the **Routing**
category. Because the **Connection**
filter connects out to other services, it negotiates the SSL handshake involved in setting up a mutually authenticated secure channel.

Depending on how the API Gateway is perceived by the client, different combinations of routing filters can be used. For an introduction to using the various filters in the **Routing**
category, see
[Get started with routing configuration](/csh?context=625&product=prod-api-gateway-77)
in the
[API Gateway Policy Developer Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/)
.
