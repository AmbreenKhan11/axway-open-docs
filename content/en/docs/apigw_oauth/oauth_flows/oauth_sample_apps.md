To run a sample script:

1. Open a UNIX shell or DOS command prompt in the following directory:

``` {space="preserve"}
    INSTALL_DIR/samples/scripts
```

2. Use the `run.sh` or `run.bat` utility to execute the appropriate script.

The following example shows how to run the `implicit_grant.py` sample script:

``` {space="preserve"}
sh run.sh oauth/implicit_grant.py
```
