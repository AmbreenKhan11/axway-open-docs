Overview
--------

API Gateway uses the information configured in the **Static Router**
filter to connect to a machine that is hosting a web service. You should use the **Static Router**
filter in conjunction with a **Rewrite URL**
filter to specify the path to send the message to on the remote machine. For more details, see *Rewrite URL* on page 1.

Depending on how API Gateway is perceived by the client, different combinations of routing filters can be used. For an introduction to using the various filters in the **Routing**
category, see
[Get started with routing configuration](/csh?context=625&product=prod-api-gateway-77)
in the
[API Gateway Policy Developer Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/)
.
