Overview
--------

Cron expressions are used in policy execution scheduling, and within several filters (for example, the **Time** utility filter).

The **Cron Dialog**
enables you to create a cron expression used to trigger regularly occurring events (for example, generate a report, or block or allow messages at specified times). You can use the time tabs in this dialog to guide you through the configuration steps.

Alternatively, enter the cron expression value directly in the text boxes. When you have created the cron expression, you can click the **Test Cron**
button to test the value of the cron expression and see when it is next due to fire.

For background information and details on cron expression syntax, see [*Policy execution scheduling* on page 1](general_cron_schedule.htm).

Create a cron expression using the time tabs
--------------------------------------------

Using the time tabs in the dialog to guide you through the configuration steps is the default option. You can create a cron expression to trigger at the specified times using the following settings:

<div>

### Seconds

Select one of the following options:

-   **Every Second of the Minute**
-   Fires every second of the minute. This is the default setting.
-   **Just on Second**
-   Fires only on the specified second of the minute.
-   **Range from Second**
-   Fires over a range of seconds. For example, if the first value is 10 and the second value is 25, the trigger starts firing on second 10 of the minute and continues to fire for 15 seconds.
-   **Start on Second**
-   Fires on the specified second of the minute and repeats every specified number of seconds. For example, if the first number is 15 and the second number is 30, the trigger fires at 15 seconds and repeats every 30 seconds until stopped.
-   **On Multiple Seconds**
-   Fires on the specified seconds of each minute. Enter a comma separated list of seconds (values of `0-59`
    inclusive). For example, `10,20,30`.

Enter a cron expression
-----------------------

To enter the cron expression value directly in the dialog, click **Create cron expression using edit boxes**, and enter the values in the appropriate boxes. For example, the following cron expression fires on April 27 and 28, at any time except between 10:00:01 and 10:59:59:

    * * 0-9,11-23 27-28 APR ?

For details on cron expression syntax and special characters, see [*Policy execution scheduling* on page 1](general_cron_schedule.htm).

</div>

<div id="p_common_cron_expression_test">

Test the cron expression
------------------------

When you have configured the cron expression using either approach, click the **Test Cron**
button to test the syntax of the cron expression value and view when it is next due to fire. If the configured cron expression is invalid, a warning dialog is displayed.

<div>

### Results

The test results include the following output:

**Expression**
Displays the configured cron expression. For example: `* * 9-17 * * ? *`
**Next Fire Times**
Displays when cron expression is next due to fire. For example: `Next fire event:Fri Jul 22 10:26:09 EST 2012`
