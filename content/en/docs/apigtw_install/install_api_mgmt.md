API Manager is an additional licensed layered product running on the Axway API Gateway. For more details, see the
[API Manager User Guide](/bundle/APIManager_77_APIMgmtGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/)
.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Windows is supported only for a limited set of developer tools, see [Install developer tools on Windows](../../../InstallGuideTopics/install_dev_tools.htm). API Gateway and API Manager do not support Windows.{{< /alert >}}

Prerequisites
-------------

Ensure that all of the prerequisites detailed in [Prerequisites](TemplateTopics/prereqs/prereqs_overview.htm#top)
are met.

### Axway license file

You must have a valid Axway license file to install API Manager. To obtain an evaluation trial license or a full license, contact your Axway Account Manager.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Your API Gateway installation must also be licensed. If you do not have a license for API Gateway, you cannot install API Manager.{{< /alert >}}

### Domains with multiple nodes

In an API Gateway domain environment with multiple machine nodes, API Manager must be installed on API Gateway instance nodes.

### Apache Cassandra

The Apache Cassandra database is required to store API Manager data. You can install Cassandra separately before installing API Manager, or when installing API Manager. For more details, see topic '*Install an Apache Cassandra database*' in the [Install API Gateway](TemplateTopics/install/install_overview.htm) section.

--enable-components apimgmt,apigateway,nodemanager,cassandra
--disable-components qstart,policystudio,configurationstudio,
analytics,apitester,packagedeploytools
--licenseFilePath mylicense.lic
--apimgmtLicenseFilePath mymgmtlicense.lic
```

Configure API Manager
---------------------

If you selected to install the QuickStart tutorial, API Manager is configured by default. If you did not install the QuickStart tutorial, you must configure API Manager. For more details, see the
