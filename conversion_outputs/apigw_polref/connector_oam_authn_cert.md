Overview
--------

The **Log in with certificate**
filter enables authentication to Oracle Access Manager (OAM) using an X.509 certificate presented by the client. After successful authentication, OAM issues a Single Sign On (SSO) token, which can then be used by the client for subsequent calls to the virtualized service.

See also [*Oracle Access Manager authorization* on page 1](connector_oam_authz.htm).

General settings
----------------

Configure the following general settings:

**Name**:\
Enter an appropriate name for this filter to display in a policy.

**Attribute containing X509 certificate**:\
Enter the name of the message attribute that contains the user's X.509 certificate. By default, this is stored in the `certificate`
message attribute.

**Attribute to contain SSO token id**:\
Enter the name of the message attribute to contain the user's SSO token. By default, the SSO token is stored in the `oracle.sso.token`
message attribute.

</div>

<div id="p_connector_oam_authn_cert_resource_config">

Resource settings
-----------------

Configure the following resource settings:

**Resource Type**:\
Enter the type of the resource for which you are requesting access. For example, when seeking access to a web-based URL, enter `http`.

**Resource Name**:\
Enter the name of the resource for which the user is requesting access. By default, this field is set to `//hostname${http.request.uri}`, which contains the original path requested by the client.

**Operation**:\
In most access management products, it is common to authorize users fora limited set of actions on the requested resource. For example, users with management roles may be able to write (HTTP POST) to a certain web service, but users with more junior roles might only have read access (HTTP GET) to the same service.

You can use this field to specify the operation to grant the user access to on the specified resource. By default, this field is set to the `http.request.verb`
message attribute, which contains the HTTP verb used by the client to send the message to the API Gateway (for example, POST).

**Include query string**:\
Select whether the query string parameters are used by the OAM server to determine the policy that protects this resource. This setting is optional if the policies configured do not rely on the query string parameters.

Session settings
----------------

Configure the following session settings:

**Location**:\
If the client location must be passed to OAM for it to make its decision, you can enter a valid DNS name or IP address to specify this location.

**Parameters**:\
You can add optional additional parameters to be used in the authentication decision. The available optional parameters include the following:

|              |                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ip`         | IP address, in dotted decimal notation, of the client accessing the resource.                                                                       |
| `operation`  | Operation attempted on the resource (for HTTP resources, one of `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, `DELETE`, `TRACE`, `OPTIONS`, `CONNECT`, or `OTHER`). |
| `resource`   | The requested resource identifier (for HTTP resources, the full URL).                                                                               |
| `targethost` | The host (`host:port`) to which resource request is sent.                                                                                           |

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}One or more of these optional parameters might be required by certain authentication schemes, modules, or plug-ins configured in the OAM server. To determine which parameters to add, see your OAM server documentation.{{< /alert >}}

OAM Access SDK settings
-----------------------

Configure the following fields for the OAM Access SDK:

**OAM ASDK Directory**:\
Enter the path to your OAM Access SDK directory. For more details on the OAM Access SDK, see your Oracle Access Manager documentation.
