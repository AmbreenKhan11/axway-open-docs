Hardware Security Modules (HSM) protect the private keys they hold using a variety of mechanisms, including physical tokens, passphrases, and other methods. When use of the private key is required by some agent, it must authenticate itself with the HSM, and be authorized to access this data.

Whatever the mechanism protecting the keys on the HSM, this commonly requires some interaction with the agent. The most common form of interaction required is for the agent to present a passphrase. The intent is generally that this is carried out by a real person, rather than produced mechanically by the agent. Other forms of interaction may include prompting the operator to insert a specific card into a card reader.

However, the requirement for an operator to enter a passphrase renders automated startup of services using the HSM impossible. Although weaker from a security standpoint, the server can conduct an automated dialog with a HSM when it requires access to a private key, presenting specific responses to specific requests, including feeding passphrases to it. Of course, this is futile if the dialog calls for the insertion of a physical token in a device.

The dialog for different keys on the same device is often the same. For example, a number of keys on a Thales nShield Solo HSM may require the server to present an operator passphrase for a preinserted card in a card-reader. The specific dialogs are therefore associated with the cryptographic engine.

Each dialog consists of a set of expected request-generated response pairs. The expected request takes the form of a regular expression. When the cryptographic device prompts for input, the text of this prompt is compared against each expected request in the conversation, until a match is found. When matched, the corresponding generated response is delivered to the HSM.

In the simplest case, consider a HSM producing the following prompt:

    Enter passphrase for operator card Operator1:

You can identify this, for example, with the following regular expression:

``` {space="preserve"}
"passphrase.*Operator1"
```

In the configured conversation, you can make the expected response to this prompt the passphrase for the specific card, for example:

``` {space="preserve"}
"tellNoOne"
```

The server is somewhat at the mercy of the HSM for how this dialog continues. If the HSM continues to prompt for requests, the server can only attempt to respond. You may set the maximum expected challenge setting on the conversation to indicate a maximum number of prompts to expect from the HSM, at which point the server does its best to terminate the conversation, almost certainly failing to load the affected key.
