Overview
--------

An HTTP cookie is data sent by a server in an HTTP response to a client. The client can then return an updated cookie value in subsequent requests to the server. For example, this enables the server to store user preferences, manage sessions, track browsing habits, and so on.

The **Get Cookie**
filter is used to read the `Cookie`
and `Set-Cookie`
HTTP headers. The `Cookie`
header is used when a client sends a cookie to a server. The `Set-Cookie`
header is used when the server instructs the client to store a cookie.

For more details, see [*Create cookie* on page 1](conversion_create_cookie.htm).

Attribute storage
-----------------

When a cookie is retrieved, it is stored in the appropriate API Gateway message attribute. The following message attributes are used to store cookies:

| Cookie Header Type | Message Attribute Name                     |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Cookie`           | `cookie.cookie_name.value`                 
  (for example, `cookie.mytest.value`)        |
| `Set-Cookie`       | `cookie.cookie_name.cookie_attribute_name` 
  (for example, `cookie.mytest.header`)       |

### **Set-Cookie attribute list**\

The `Set-Cookie`
HTTP header includes the following cookie attributes (reflected in the `Set-Cookie`
message attribute name):
