Overview
--------

You can filter the Policy Studio navigation tree on the left of the window to display specified tree nodes only. You can click the **Options**
link at the bottom of the tree to display additional viewing options. These enable you to configure whether management services and tree node configuration types are displayed in the tree. Finally, you can configure how the Policy Studio policy filter palette is displayed on the right of the window when editing policies.

Filter the tree
---------------

To filter the tree by a specific node name, enter the name in the text box above the tree. When you enter a name (for example, `SOAP Schema`), the tree is filtered automatically, and all occurrences are displayed in the tree.

Filtering the tree is especially useful in cases where many policies have been configured in the Policy Studio, and you wish to find a specific tree node (for example, a schema filter named **Check against SOAP Schema**).

Configure viewing options
-------------------------

When you click the **Options**
link at the bottom left of the navigation tree, you can configure the following viewing option:

**Show Types**:\
Select this option to show the **Type**
column in the Policy Studio navigation tree. This shows the type of each node in the tree (for example, *HTTP Service*
or *Remote Host*). This option is not selected by default. When this option is selected, you can use the **Filter by type**
setting.

Configure the policy filter palette
-----------------------------------

When editing policies, you can configure how the Policy Studio policy filter palette is displayed on the right of the window. Right-click the filter palette, and select from the following options:

**Layout**:\
Specifies how the filters are displayed in each category in the palette. By default, the filters are displayed in a list. Select one of the following options from the context menu:

-   Columns
-   List
-   Icons Only
-   Details

**Customize**:\
The **Customize Palette**
dialog enables you to customize each of the items displayed in the filter palette. Select a node in the tree on the left to display what can be customized on the right. For example, you can edit a filter name and description, specify whether it is hidden, and add tags to help searches. In addition, you can use the buttons above the tree to add or delete new category drawers or separators. You can also move a selected category drawer up or down in the palette.

**Settings**:\
The **Palette Settings**
dialog enables you to customize settings such as fonts, layout, and category drawer options (for example, close each drawer automatically when there is not enough room on the window).

**Restore Palette Defaults**:\
Restores all the palette settings from a default API Gateway installation.
