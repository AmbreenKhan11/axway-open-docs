Manage and secure the APIs you have registered as API proxies in AMPLIFY Central.

Secure an API
-------------

You can apply policies to an API proxy to manage access to your API from client applications.

In the [AMPLIFY Central quick start](new_users/quickstart.htm), you learned how to secure your API with a client authentication policy, using an API key as an example.

You can also secure your API with a JWT client authentication policy. To learn how to generate a JWT and how to apply a JWT client authentication policy to an API, see [Secure an API with JWT](api_mgmt/secure_api_jwt.htm).
