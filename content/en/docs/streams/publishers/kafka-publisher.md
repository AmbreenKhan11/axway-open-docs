Streams can act as a consumer of your dedicated Apache Kafka cluster.

It consumes records from one configured topic and then publishes those records into Streams platform in order to broadcast data to subscribers if a change is detected between two records.

# Kafka publisher configuration

Configuring an Apache Kafka publisher requires some specific configuration. Configuration is inspired from the official Kafka consumer API.

| Configuration Entry | Mandatory | Possible value             | Default value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
