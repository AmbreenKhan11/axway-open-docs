{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}The API Tester component is deprecated, and is only installed in a **Custom** setup. For more details, see [Install API Tester](install_api_tester.htm).{{< /alert >}}

### QuickStart tutorial

The **Standard** and **Complete** setup types install the QuickStart tutorial by default, or you can select to install it during the **Custom** setup type. This installs a preconfigured domain and API Gateway instance. If you do not install the QuickStart tutorial, you must configure a domain and API Gateway instance when the installation is complete. For more details, see [Initial configuration](TemplateTopics/post-install/post_overview.htm#Initial).

Click **Next** to continue.

Select components
-----------------

This window is only displayed during an **Custom** installation.

Select the components to be installed, and deselect those that are not to be installed. The following components are selected by default:

-   API Gateway Server
-   Admin Node Manager
-   Policy Studio desktop tool

Click **Next** to continue.

Specify installation directory
------------------------------

Enter a location or click the browse button to specify the directory where the API Gateway components are to be installed, for example:

    /opt/Axway-7.8

Click **Next** to continue.

Specify license file
--------------------

Enter the location or click the browse button to specify a valid Axway license file. For more details, see [Software and license keys](TemplateTopics/prereqs/prereqs_software_and_license_keys.htm#top).

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}API Gateway, API Gateway Analytics, and API Manager each require a valid Axway license file. If you have separate license files for each of these components, specify the API Gateway license at this step, and you will be prompted for the API Gateway Analytics and API Manager license files at a later step. Alternatively, you can specify a single license file that covers all licensed components.{{< /alert >}}

Cassandra configuration
-----------------------

If you selected to install an Apache Cassandra database, configure the following settings:

-   **Installation Directory**:\
    Enter the directory in which to install the Cassandra server (for example, `/opt/db/cassandra`).
-   {{< alert title="Caution" color="warning" >}}Do not install Apache Cassandra in the same directory as the API Gateway components to avoid errors during the Cassandra upgrade.{{< /alert >}}
-   **JRE Location**:\
    Enter the directory of the Java Runtime Environment used by Cassandra. The default value is the location of the JRE provided by API Gateway (for example, `INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/Linux.x86_64/jre/bin`). If you have installed a separate JRE for Cassandra, enter its location instead.
-   For details of the Cassandra JRE requirements and recommendations, see [Cassandra prerequisites](cassandra_install.htm#Cassandr).

Set the administrator credentials for the Admin Node Manager
------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to secure your API Gateway system to protect it from internal and external threats. This window enables you to set the administrator user name and password used to log in to Policy Studio and API Gateway Manager. These administrator credentials are also used by `managedomain` when connecting to an Admin Node Manager.

Select **Change the default user name and password** to set the user name and password for the administrator account, and enter a user name and password. This option is selected by default to ensure that you set your own administrator user name and password. To use a default administrator user name and password, you must deselect this option. The default credentials are available from your Axway account manager.

{{< alert title="Caution" color="warning" >}}You must ensure that you remember these credentials or you will not be able to log in to Policy Studio or API Gateway Manager.
This is especially important when planning to install Policy Studio on Windows later because you do not have the option to set the credentials then.{{< /alert >}}

Click **Next** to continue.
