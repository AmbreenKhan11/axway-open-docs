Overview
--------

The **Convert Multipart/compound body type**
filter is typically used to compress a MIME message before transferring a message using FTP to an FTP server. You could create a simple policy containing a **Convert Multipart/compound body type**
filter as a predecessor of an **FTP Upload**
filter to achieve this functionality.

The **Convert Multipart/compound body type**
filter outputs a `content.body`
message attribute, which represents the last part processed. For example, in a three part multipart message, the value of the `content.body`
attribute is the third and last part in the series.
