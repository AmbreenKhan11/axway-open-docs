Overview
--------

This filter sets the HTTP status code on response messages. This enables you to ensure that a more meaningful response is sent to the client in the case of an error occurring in a configured policy.

For example, if a **Relative Path**
filter fails, it might be useful to return a `503 Service Unavailable`
response. Similarly, if a user does not present identity credentials when attempting to access a protected resource, you can configure API Gateway to return a `401 Unauthorized`
response to the client.

HTTP status codes are returned in the *status-line*
of an HTTP response. The following are some typical examples:

``` {space="preserve"}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
```

``` {space="preserve"}
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
```

``` {space="preserve"}
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
```
