Overview
--------

The API Gateway can strip a named HTTP header from the message as it passes through a policy. This is especially useful in cases where end user credentials are passed to the API Gateway in an HTTP header. After processing the credentials, you can use the **Remove HTTP Header**
filter to strip the header from the message to ensure that it is not forwarded on to the destination web service.

Configuration
-------------

To configure the **Remove HTTP Header**
filter, perform the following steps:

1.  Enter an appropriate name for this filter in the **Name**
    field.
2.  Specify the name of the HTTP header to remove in the **HTTP Header Name**
    field.
3.  Select **Fail if header is not present**
    to configure the API Gateway to abort the filter if the message does not contain the named HTTP header. Headers can be added to the message using the **Add HTTP Header** filter (see [*Add HTTP header* on page 1](conversion_add_header.htm)).
