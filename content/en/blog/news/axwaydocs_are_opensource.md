The ReadMeFirst team of technical writers based in Dublin is proud to announce the beta availability of docs-as-code for AMPLIFY Central and API Portal 7.8 documentation. In other words, this documentation is now open source and everyone in Axway can collaborate and improve it using what's commonly known as a docs-as-code workflow, where docs are:

- written in a simple Markdown format
- stored in GitHub
- anyone can edit them by submitting a pull request
- technical writers review and publish the changes to the production website.

These docs are publicly available, but because this is a beta process we're only advertising it for Axway employees. Our expectation is to use your feedback to improve the process, then, make it available to customers. 

Although the collaboration process is in beta availability, all updates to the docs continue to be published to the production portal - https://docs.axway.com/

## Ways to collaborate

Open source docs is a growing trend. Other big companies such as Docker, Amazon, and Microsoft have opened their documentation for collaboration using a GitHub forking and pull request workflow.

In Axway, ReadMeFirst team implemented the GitHub workflow and, thinking of non-technical users, who perhaps don't have knowledge of GitHub or Markdown, we also implemented a Netlify content management system (CMS) workflow, which allows you to edit a page on a WYSIWYG editor.

## Axway Open Documentation website

The open source docs are available at https://axway-open-docs.netlify.com/. You must click the Documentation link to access the pages. From now on, this is your one-stop source to browse and edit API product documentation.

If you find anything to be fixed or improved on a page, you can edit it directly instead of opening Jira tickets, to speed up the process of updating the doc. A technical writer will review your edits, then publish the updated documentation to https://docs.axway.com.

Please read the Contribution guidelines to learn more about how to improve Axway docs, and let us know your feedback or if you have any questions.

## Limitations of the beta version

Additional information about the limitations of this beta version and some FAQs specific to Axway internal users are available on Confluence at https://techweb.axway.com/confluence/display/RDAPI/Collaborate+on+Markdown+content (requires Axway login)

## Coming soon

ReadMeFirst team is currently working on migrating the API Gateway and API Manager 7.8 content to this workflow, and we will be continually improving the new process based on your feedback.

Thanks a lot!
