We are very excited to announce the availability of the latest version of API Gateway and API Manager documentation in our open source docs-as-code workflow! Following on from [Open source documentation is here for AMPLIFY Central and API Portal](/blog/2019/09/18/open-source-documentation-is-here-for-amplify-central-and-api-portal-7.8/) we have now migrated all of the API Gateway and API Manager content as well (except for a few low priority guides which will follow later).

## What does this mean for you?

Anyone can now propose changes to any topic in the AMPLIFY API Management or AMPLIFY Central documentation using a quick and easy process. All you need is a [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account.

To get started go to [AMPLIFY API Management and AMPLIFY Central documentation | Axway Open Documentation](/docs/).

Here's a short animation demonstrating how to make and preview a change with Netlify CMS:
