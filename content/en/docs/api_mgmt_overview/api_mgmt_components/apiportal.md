## API Portal

API Portal is a self-service web-based portal that enables API consumers to consume APIs that you have exposed using API Manager. API consumers can register and manage their user profile, register applications, manage application credentials, browse front-end APIs and supporting documentation, monitor application API usage, and access blogs, forums, and so on.

API Portal is implemented as a stand-alone CMS-based portal, which you can run using the default Axway branding and functionality, or customize and extend to meet your specific requirements and those of your target API consumers. You can deploy the internet-facing API Portal separately from the API Gateway and API Manager, with a dedicated web interface to limit potential security breaches.

The main API Portal features are as follows:

**Developer self-registration and profile management**\

Client application developers can self-register and manage their profiles.

**Browse and test APIs in the API Catalog**\

The API Catalog contains the APIs that have been registered in API Manager and are available for use by client application developers. They can browse these APIs and their associated documentation, and invoke APIs using the built-in test capability.

**Create and manage applications**\

Application developers can register their applications that will use the APIs, and obtain API key or OAuth credentials for the application. They can also monitor their application's use of APIs using graphical data sourced from your API Manager metrics database.

**Content management, blogs, and discussion forums**\

API Portal runs on Joomla!™, an open source CMS platform for developing and deploying web sites. You can use the content management capabilities of Joomla! to store additional content, such as PDF documents and video, for display in API Portal. Joomla! also provides plugins for third-party blog and discussion forums.

**Customizable to provide a branded experience**\

You can deploy API Portal with no customization, using the out-of-the-box Axway branding, which is suitable for internal-facing API deployments. For external-facing API deployments, you can customize API Portal to provide a branded developer portal experience. You can customize API Portal using Joomla configuration screens (upgradeable), or by editing the API Portal PHP source code (not upgradeable).
