Overview
--------

The **HTTP Parser**
filter parses the HTTP request headers and body. As such, it acts as a barrier in the policy to guarantee that the entire content has been received before any other filters are invoked. It requires the `content.body`
attribute.

The **HTTP Parser**
filter forces the server to do *store-and-forward*
routing instead of the default *cut-through*
routing, where the request is only parsed on-demand. For example, you can use this filter as a simple test to ensure that the message is XML.
