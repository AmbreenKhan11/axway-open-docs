A *Key Property Store* (KPS) is a table of data referenced by policies running on an API Gateway. Data in a KPS table is assumed to be read frequently and seldom written, and can be changed without incurring an API Gateway service outage. KPS tables are shared across an API Gateway group. Data can be stored in one of the following locations:

A KPS is typically used to store property values used in policies on an API Gateway. KPS data is injected into policies using selectors created in Policy Studio. Selectors are evaluated and expanded dynamically at runtime. For example, a KPS table contains authorization tokens for different users. A policy looks up the token for the current user, and inserts it into an HTTP request.

{{< alert title="Caution" color="warning" >}}Do not edit the default KPS tables in Policy Studio unless under strict supervision from Axway Support. This includes the **API Server**, **OAuth**, or **API Portal** KPS tables available under **Environment Configuration > Key Property Stores**.{{< /alert >}}

For more details on Key Property Stores, see the
[API Gateway Key Property Store User Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_KPSUserGuide_allOS_en_HTML5)
.

KPS tables and collections
--------------------------

KPS tables are organized into *collections*. The tables in a collection typically have a relationship to each other. For example, the OAuth collection contains a set of tables that store all OAuth-related data. Every KPS table is assigned an *alias* so that it can be easily referred to in a policy or a REST request.

| **Column**  | **Type**  | **Description**                                                                  |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `email`     | `String`  | User email address. This is the primary key used to identify a row in the table. |
| `password`  | `String`  | User password. This confidential data is encrypted.                              |
| `firstName` | `String`  | User first name.                                                                 |
| `lastName`  | `String`  | User surname.                                                                    |
| `age`       | `Integer` | User age.                                                                        |

Enter data in a KPS table
-------------------------

You can enter data in a KPS table using the API Gateway Manager web console for viewing and modifying data. This is available in API Gateway Manager under **Settings > Key Property Stores**. The `kpsadmin` command-line tool also supports data entry in addition to other administrative functions. KPS data can also be read and written by remote programmatic clients using the KPS REST interface.

New values for encrypted fields are always transmitted to the server in the clear. For security, always use HTTPS when accessing KPS over its REST API (this is the default).

The following example shows some simple table data that has been entered in API Gateway Manager, and which follows the example structure in [*KPS tables and collections* on page 1](#KPS):

| **`email`**        | **`password`** | **`firstName`** | **`lastName`** | **`age`** |
|--------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| `jdoe@acme.com`    | `*****`        | `John`          | `Doe`          | `21`      |
| `jbloggs@acme.com` | `*****`        | `Joe`           | `Bloggs`       | `42`      |
| `jdupont@acme.com` | `*****`        | `Jean`          | `Dupont`       | `33`      |

In this example, the `email` column is the primary key. You can use this to look up and uniquely identify a row using a selector expression. For example, the following selector expression evaluates to `John`:

    ${kps.customers["jdoe@acme.com"].firstName}

The following selector expression evaluates to `42`:

    ${kps.customers["jbloggs@acme.com"].age}

For more details on selectors, see [*Select configuration values at runtime* on page 1](general_selector.htm).

KPS data sources
----------------

A KPS provides a consistent interface to data that can be stored in different data sources. API Gateway supports the following KPS data sources:

**JSON files on the local file system**: Suited to single API Gateway deployments. In a multi-API Gateway scenario, file replication or a shared disk is required to ensure all API Gateways use the same data.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}} If a file-based KPS table is shared across API Gateways, the API Gateways must be restarted after data has changed. File-based KPS is deprecated in this release.{{< /alert >}}

Add a KPS collection
--------------------

A KPS collection is a group of KPS tables. To add a KPS collection, perform the following steps:
The newly created KPS collection is displayed on the window on the right.

1.  In the Policy Studio tree, right-click **Environment Configuration > Key Property Stores**, and select **Add KPS Collection**.
2.  Complete the following fields in the **Add KPS Collection** dialog:
