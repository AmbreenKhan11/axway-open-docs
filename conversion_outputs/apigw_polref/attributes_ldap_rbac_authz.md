Overview
--------

The **LDAP RBAC**
filter combines Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This filter enables you to authorize a backend service based on user roles stored using LDAP. You can use the **LDAP RBAC**
filter to read an attribute from LDAP, and compare it against some known values (for example, if `role`
contains `engineering`, authorize the user). This filter combines functionality available in the **Retrieve from Directory Server**
and **Compare Attribute** filters.

The **LDAP RBAC**
filter enables you to define LDAP connection and search settings, and to configure how specified message attributes are processed. This filter also enables you to configure optional settings such as results caching and actions to take if a returned attribute is multivalued.

General settings
----------------

Configure the following fields on the **Settings**
tab:

**Connection**:\
Click the button on the right to select your preconfigured LDAP directory server (for example, `openldap.qa.axway.com`). For details on how to configure LDAP servers, see
[Configure LDAP directories](/csh?context=617&product=prod-api-gateway-77)
in the
[API Gateway Policy Developer Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/)
.

**Search Base**:\
Enter the Distinguished Name (DN) to use as the base from which the search starts (for example, `o=Axway,l=Dublin 4,st=Dublin,C=IE`).

**Filter**:\
Enter the search filter to use. For example:

    (&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(cn=${authentication.subject.id}))

**Scope**:\
Select one of the following search scopes from the list.

-   **Object**: Searches on the base DN only (compare)
-   **One Level**: Searches the direct children of the base DN
-   **Subtree**: Searches the base DN and all its descendants

Defaults to **Subtree**.

**Attribute validation rules**:\
When the search completes, the attributes returned in the results are processed by the rules in the **Attribute validation rules**
table. This processing is the same as the **Compare Attribute**
filter. You can logically `AND`
and `OR`
rules together in the **Filter will pass if**
list by selecting **all**
or **one**.

For example, if **Filter will pass if**
is set to **all**, and Rule A, Rule B, and Rule C all evaluate to true, the filter passes. However, if Rule A evaluates to false, the filter fails. If the **Filter will pass**
is set to **one**, and Rule A and Rule B evaluate to false, but Rule C evaluates to true, the filter passes. However, if Rule C evaluates to false, the filter fails.

Select **all**
or **one**
of the specified conditions to apply. Click the **Add**
button at the bottom right to specify a rule condition. In the **Attribute filter rule**
dialog, perform the following steps:

1.  Enter a message attribute name in the **LDAP attribute named**
    field (for example, `member`
    or `mail`).
2.  Select one of the following rule conditions from the list:
    -   `contains`
    -   `doesn't contain`
    -   `doesn't match regular expression`
    -   `ends with`
    -   `is`
    -   `is not`
    -   `matches regular expression`
    -   `starts with`

    >
3.  Enter a value to compare with in the text box on the right (for example, `POST`). Alternatively, you can enter a selector that is expanded at runtime (for example, `${http.request.uri}`). For more details on selectors, see
    [Select configuration values at runtime](/csh?context=630&product=prod-api-gateway-77)
    in the
    [API Gateway Policy Developer Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/)
    .
4.  Click **OK**.

The following figure shows some example search settings and attribute validation rules:

![LDAP Attribute Authorization Settings](/Images/docbook/images/attr/ldap_rbac_authz.png)

{{< alert title="Tip" color="primary" >}}When using this filter to determine if a user is a member of a `groupOfNames`, all the member attributes are concatenated together. The string containing the member attributes can be compared using a regular expression value provided in **Attribute validation rules**. {{< /alert >}}
<div class="indentTable">

Because each attribute is not checked individually, you must create the regular expression string appropriately. For example, an expression such as `(?i:^.*${cert.subject.id}.*$)`
allows for extra characters before and after the string searched for.

Advanced settings
-----------------

You can configure the following optional settings on the **Advanced**
tab:

**Cache settings**:\
Select whether to cache the LDAP search results. This setting is selected by default.

**Store results in the cache**:\
Click the button on the right to select the preconfigured cache in which to store results. For more details on caches, see the
[API Gateway Policy Developer Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/)
. Select one of the following settings:

-   **Use the LDAP search filter as cache key**: Uses the LDAP search filter configured on the **Settings**
    tab as the cache key.
-   **Or use the following value as the cache key**: Enter a specific value for the cache key.

**If returned attribute contains multiple values**:\
Select one of the following settings:

-   **Concatenate values with the following**: Enter the character used to concatenate multiple attribute values. A comma is used by default.
-   **Use value at index**: Enter the index number of the attribute value to use. Defaults to `0`.
