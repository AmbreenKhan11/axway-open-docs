  How to contribute to Axway-Open-Docs
---

All the documentation on this website is written in Markdown. The textual content is stored in the `/content/en/docs/` folder, and the images, in the `/static/Images/<guide_name>` folder.

We support the following contribution flows:

* Pull request (PR) via GitHub UI (ideal for small or infrequent changes).
* Pull request via Netlify CMS (WYSIWYG option is ideal for non-technical users).
* Pull request via Git CLI (ideal for bigger changes or regular updates). See [Setup and work locally](/docs/contribution_guidelines/setup_work_locally).

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
All flows require a GitHub account.
{{< /alert >}}

While you can also create issues on GitHub to ask for updates, it's faster to create a pull request and make the updates yourself.

## Licensing

Before you can contribute to Axway-open-docs you must sign the [Axway Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla.axway.com/) using your GitHub account.

This is required just once and it should only take a few minutes.

## What to expect when you contribute

When you submit a PR, our team is notified and will respond as quickly as we can. We'll review your PR and ensure that the changes adhere to Axway style and standards by making additional edits for style or clarity.

We'll contact you if we need further information regards to your PR.

{{< alert title="Note" >}}
GitHub will send you an email notification for every update in your PR or issue.

When the review is finished, we'll merge your PR to this staging website first <https://axway-open-docs.netlify.com/>, then to production <https://docs.axway.com>.

  * This link redirects to the main page of the documentation. You must navigate to the page you've edited.
  * This link opens in the same tab of your PR.

## Create an issue on GitHub

Create an issue to inform us about a problem in the documentation. Please provide detailed information, for example, if it's missing information, an error in a procedure, information not clear, a broken link, and so on. The more details you provide, the more helpful the issue, and the faster we can prioritize and fix it.

To create an issue just click **Create documentation issue** on the upper right corner of the page, and add the relevant information.

## Edit with Netlify CMS

Use the Netlify CMS user interface to easily edit the docs in a WYSIWYG editor with a real-time preview. You don't need to be familiar with Markdown to edit docs in Netlify CMS.

To edit a page in Netlify CMS:

* Click **Edit on Netlify CMS** on the upper right corner of the page.
* Sign in to Netlify CMS using your GitHub account.
* Click to fork the repository.
* On the Netlify CMS landing page, locate the page you want to change and click to edit it.
* Make the updates and click **Save**.
* You can preview the changes on the right side preview editor.
    ![WYSIWYG editor](/images/contributing/netlify_WYSIWYGeditor.png)

* When you finish all the updates, change the status of the content to 'In review'.

    ![Set status to Review](/images/contributing/netlify_setstatustoreview.png)

{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning">}}
Do not make any more updates to the page after changing its status to 'In review', as this will close the pull request automatically created for your updates.
{{< /alert >}}

* You will receive an email automatically generated by *Netlify CMS* with the link for the pull request created in GitHub for your update.
