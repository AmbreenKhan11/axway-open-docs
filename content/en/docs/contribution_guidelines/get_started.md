<!-- Commented out next part as I don't think it's useful, the blog could be used for announcing when each guide is available for contributions!-->

All documentation on this website is written in Markdown, and it is stored in `/content/en/docs/`.

We support the following contribution flows:

* Pull request (PR) via GitHub UI (ideal for small or infrequent changes).
* Pull request via Netlify CMS (WYSIWYG option is ideal for non-technical users).
* Pull request via Git CLI (ideal for bigger changes or regular updates). See [Setup and work locally](/docs/contribution_guidelines/setup_work_locally).

While you can also create issues on GitHub to ask for updates, it's faster to create a pull request and make the updates yourself.

## What to expect when you contribute

When you submit a PR, our team is notified and will respond as quickly as we can. We'll review your PR and ensure that the changes adhere to Axway style and standards by making additional edits for style or clarity.

We'll contact you if we need further information regards to your PR.

When the review is finished, we'll merge your PR to this staging website first <https://improve-apim-docs.netlify.com/>, then to production <https://docs.axway.com>.

## Additional resources

<!--We shouldn't list anything that won't be accessible outside Axway network. Let's discuss what to put here. Maybe a separate topic on resources would be better, as that could cover style, markdown, editors, linters etc. -->
