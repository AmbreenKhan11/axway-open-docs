Having completed the integration steps, you can now test the setup using the cURL testing utility. Assuming you are running API Gateway on a machine called `apigateway` on the default port of `8080`, you can send a POST request to the newly created policy on API Gateway using HTTP basic authentication with the following command:

``` {space="preserve"}
> curl --user weblogic:weblogic --data "test=data" http://apiserver:8080/oam
User 'weblogic' was authenticated and authorized successfully!
```

You can see that the success message has been returned by API Gateway meaning that the `weblogic` user has been successfully authenticated and authorized by OAM to access the resource. A quick look at the API Gateway's trace output shows that the `weblogic` user has been authenticated and authorized to access the `//oam.example.com/oam` resource.

```

Now, check what happens when authenticating with a user that has not been configured in OAM:

``` {space="preserve"}
> curl --user admin:changeme --data "test=data" http://apiserver:8080/oam
Access Denied!
```

If you look at the API Gateway's trace output again, you can see that the filter has blocked the authorization request:
