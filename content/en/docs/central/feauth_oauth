## OAuth Client Authentication Proxy Policy

API Proxies can be secured with a client authentication policy; OAuth is one of several options in AMPLIFY Central.

### Setting Up OAuth Security On An API Proxy

To require an OAuth policy on an API Proxy:

- Select the API Proxy you want to add the OAuth policy for.
- Click the "Policies" tab.
- Click the gear next to "Client authentication."
- Select "OAuth Token" from the list of options.

- Click "Save" to exit the modal.

You should now see that "OAuth Token" has been set as the selected Client authentication policy.

- Click on the "Deployments" tab.
- Deploy (or update) a valid runtime.

## Using An API Proxy Secured With An OAuth Policy

You can test your OAuth proxy within AMPLIFY Central. In order to properly use the proxy, the provider will need to setup a 3rd party OAuth server with a valid application. A single application from the 3rd party server's application will directly relate to a single AMPLIFY Central application.

### Creating An AMPLIFY Central Application Profile

After you have created an application within your 3rd party OAuth server, you will need to provide AMPLIFY Central with some of the information in order to properly use your secured proxy.

- Visit the Apps section of AMPLIFY Central. You can create a new app or use an existing one.
- Click the "Identity Profiles" tab.
- Click the "+ OAuth Profile" button on the right side of the screen.

This will open a new dialog box for your OAuth information. Choose a helpful name and description. The other fields (Client ID, Issuer, and Metadata Path) should be provided by your 3rd party OAuth server.

### Making An API Call

- Inside the API Proxy with an OAuth Client authentication policy, click the "Test Methods" tab.
- If you have more than one valid Deployment, choose the one you want to test. If you only have one, it will automatically be selected for you.
- If you have more than one valid OAuth Profile, choose the one you want to test. If you only have one, it will automatically be selected for you.

When you select a valid OAuth Profile, you will see your Client ID displayed in a read-only field. This will assist you, the provider, in generating an OAuth token from the correct application in your 3rd party OAuth server.

After your 3rd party OAuth server has generated a valid OAuth token, paste that token into the large "OAuth token" field. You may now attempt to make valid API calls with your proxy.

**NOTE:** If your token is invalid, expired, or empty, you will receive a **403: Unauthorized** response.
