The AMPLIFY API Management solution enables you to create, publish, promote, and manage Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in a secure and scalable environment.



* API Gateway is a server-side application you can use to manage, deliver, and secure APIs. API Gateway provides services such as API integration, transformation, control and governance, security, monitoring, development lifecycle, and administration.
* API Manager is a web-based API administration and management tool layered on API Gateway.
* API Portal is a self-service developer portal layered on both API Manager and API Gateway.
