Overview
--------

An HTTP cookie is data sent by a server in an HTTP response to a client. The client can then return an updated cookie value in subsequent requests to the server. For example, this enables the server to store user preferences, manage sessions, track browsing habits, and so on.

The **Create Cookie**
filter is used to create a `Set-Cookie`
header or a `Cookie`
header. The `Set-Cookie`
header is used when the server instructs the client to store a cookie. The `Cookie`
header is used when a client sends a cookie to a server. This filter adds the appropriate HTTP cookie header to the message header, and saves the cookie as a message attribute.

For more details, see [*Get cookie* on page 1](attributes_get_cookie.htm).
