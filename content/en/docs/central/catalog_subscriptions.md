## Before you start
You will need to create an app in AMPLIFY Central and secure it with an API key. Apps are used to represent client applications that are going to consume APIs for catalog entries. You use apps to manage acess to your API or catalog entry, and to create and store credentials such as API Keys. To learn how to create an app secured with an API key, please read the [quickstart](/docs/central/quickstart).

## Objectives
Learn how to manage subscriptions to an endpoint in the AMPLIFY Catalog

## Subscribe to an endpoint in the AMPLIFY Catalog
Navigate to the AMPLIFY Catalog by using the AMPLIFY Central side-nav bar, or by using the unified nav-bar at the top of the AMPLIFY Platform.

Inside the catalog, you'll see a list of all available endpoints you can subscribe to. Click a catalog item to get a detailed view of the item's description and test methods. Then, click the "subscribe" button in the top right. Select the team you'd like to subscribe with, along with the application. Then, click "subscribe" to apply the settings. The subscription request has been sent.

## View catalog item subscriptions
In order to view a catalog item's subscriptions, click the "Subscriptions" tab on the catalog item detail page. There, you'll see a table listing the current subscriptions to that catalog item.

## Unsubscribe from a catalog item
To unsubscribe from a catlaog item, click the "Subscriptions" tab on the catalog item detail page. Then, click the gear icon next to the catalog subscription you'd like to unsubscribe. Clicking "Unsubscribe" will unsubscribe you from the catalog item.

A catalog item  subscription can only be deleted if the subscription is in "Unsubscribed" status. After unsubscribing from the catlaog item, click the "Subscriptions" tab on the catalot item detail page. Then, click the gear icon next to the catalog subscription you'd like to delete. Clicking "Delete" will delete the catalog item subscription.
