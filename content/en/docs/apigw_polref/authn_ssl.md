Overview
--------

A client can mutually authenticate to the API Gateway through the exchange of X.509 certificates. An X.509 certificate contains identity information about its owner and is digitally signed by the Certificate Authority (CA) that issued it.

A client presents such a certificate to the API Gateway while the initial SSL/TLS session is being negotiated, in other words, during the *SSL handshake*. The **SSL Authentication**
filter extracts this information from the client certificate and sets it as message attributes. These attributes can then be used by subsequent filters in the policy.

The **SSL Authentication**
filter can be used as a decision-making node on the policy. For example, it can be used to determine a path through a policy based on how users authenticate to the API Gateway.
