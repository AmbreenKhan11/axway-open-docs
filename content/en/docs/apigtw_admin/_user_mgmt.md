When logging into the Policy Studio or API Gateway Manager, you must enter the user credentials stored in the local admin user store to connect to the API Gateway server instance. Admin users are responsible for managing API Gateway instances using the API Gateway management APIs. To manage admin users, click the **Settings** > **Admin Users**
tab in the API Gateway Manager.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Admin users provide access to the API Gateway configuration management features available in the Policy Studio and API Gateway Manager. However, *API Gateway users*
provide access to the messages and services protected by the API Gateway. For more details, see [*Manage users* on page 1](general_users.htm). {{< /alert >}}

Admin user privileges
---------------------

After installation, a single admin user is defined in the API Gateway Manager with a user name of `admin`. Admin user rights in the system include the following:

-   Add another admin user
-   Delete another admin user
-   Update an admin user
-   Reset admin user passwords

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}An admin user *cannot*
delete itself.{{< /alert >}}

### Remove the default admin user

If you need to remove the default admin user, perform the following steps:

1.  Add another admin user.
2.  Log in as the new admin user.
3.  Delete the default admin user.

The **Admin Users**
tab displays all existing admin users. You can use this tab to add, update, and delete admin users. These tasks are explained in the sections that follow.

Admin user roles
----------------

The API Gateway uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to authorized users based on their assigned roles in a domain. Using this model, permissions to perform specific system operations are assigned to specific roles only. This simplifies system administration because users do not need to be assigned permissions directly, but instead acquire them through their assigned roles.

For example, the default admin user (`admin`) has the following user roles:

-   `Policy Developer`
-   `API Server Administrator`
-   `KPS Administrator`

### API Gateway user roles and privileges

User roles have specific tools and privileges assigned to them. These define who can use which tools to perform what tasks. The user roles provided with the API Gateway assign the following privileges to admin users with these roles:

| Role                       | Tool                | Privileges                                                                                    |
|----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `API Server Administrator` | API Gateway Manager | Read/write access to API Gateway Manager.                                                     |
| `API Server Operator`      | API Gateway Manager | Read-only access to API Gateway Manager.                                                      |
| `Deployer`                 | Deployment scripts  | Deploy a new configuration.                                                                   |
| `KPS Administrator`        | API Gateway Manager | Perform create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations on data in a Key Property Store (KPS). |
| `Policy Developer`         | Policy Studio       | Download, edit, deploy, version, and tag a configuration.                                     |

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}A single admin user typically has multiple roles. For example, in a development environment, a policy developer admin user would typically have the following roles:{{< /alert >}}
