If one datacenter fails, the others continue to operate, so there is no break in service. The active-active model ensures that data is continuously backed up when data is replicated between the datacenters. If you distribute your datacenters globally, you can provide a datacenter geographically close to your operations and your customers to diminish the latency in traffic."} ﻿
