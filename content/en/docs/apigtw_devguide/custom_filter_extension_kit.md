{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}The following sections refer to `jabber` sample code that is no longer included in the code samples supplied with API Gateway. We recommend that you use this section only as a general guide for writing a custom filter using the extension kit. {{< /alert >}}

In this approach, you write your custom filter using the API Gateway developer extension kit. This section details how to write a custom message filter, called the **Jabber Filter** (API Gateway runtime component and Policy Studio configuration component). It also shows how to configure it as part of a policy in Policy Studio and then demonstrates how the filter sends an instant message to an account on Google Talk.

The steps required to build, integrate, configure, and test the supplied `JabberFilter` and `JabberProcessor` sample classes are as follows:
