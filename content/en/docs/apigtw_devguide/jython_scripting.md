API Gateway contains several sample scripts that let you automate various common administration tasks. The scripts are based on the Java scripting interpreter, Jython ([http://www.jython.org](http://www.jython.org/)). Scripts can be extended to suit your needs by following the Jython language syntax. All Jython scripts can be found in the following location:

``` {space="preserve"}
INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/samples/scripts
```

To run a sample script, you can call the `run` shell in this directory and point it to the script to be run. For example, to run the `changeTrace.py` sample script:

``` {space="preserve"}
> cd INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/samples/scripts
> ./run.sh config/changeTrace.py
```

The following table summarizes the Jython scripts that are available in the API Gateway installation.
