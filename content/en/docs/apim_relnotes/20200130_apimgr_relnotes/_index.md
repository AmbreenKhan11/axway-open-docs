## Summary

API Gateway is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in Docker containers. API Manager is a licensed product running on top of API Gateway, and has the same deployment options as API Gateway.

The software installation is available on Linux. For more details on supported platforms for software installation, see [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).

Docker deployment is supported on Linux. For a summary of the system requirements for a Docker deployment, see [Set up Docker environment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_scripts_prereqs/).

## New features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements are available in this release.

<!-- Add the new features here -->

### Swagger 2.0 enhancements

API Manager imports, retains, and exports all Swagger v2.0 fields, except for vendor extensions.

### Open API Specification (OAS) 3.0 enhancements

* API Manager imports, retains, and exports all Open API Specification (OAS) v3.0 fields, except for vendor extensions, callbacks, links, and examples.
* Parameter content types are now supported in OAS3.

### Try It and Try Method improvements

API Manager's Try It and Try Method support the rendering of `enum`, which allows you to send multipart forms.

* When trying the method of an API, you can select files as part of the request
* The parameters object types are auto generated in the UI with nested schemes and arrays rendered fully
* The default for parameters are fully supported
* The `allOf` and `anyOf` in the request bodies are also supported

### Usage tracking healthchecks no longer counted
2 new environment variables have been introduced:
* EMT_HEALTHCHECK_PORT (allowable range 1025 to 65535 inclusive)
* EMT_HEALTHCHECK_PATH (a path that begins with "/" character and includes 0 or more characters" )

Both of these environment variables are optional and configurable with defaults of 8080 and "/healthcheck". The endpoint configured here will not be billed as part of the Usage tracking. 

API Manager's Try It and Try Method support the rendering of `enum`, which allows you to send multipart forms.

* When trying the method of an API, you can select files as part of the request
* The parameters object types are auto generated in the UI with nested schemes and arrays rendered fully
* The default for parameters are fully supported
* The `allOf` and `anyOf` in the request bodies are also supported

### Back-end API improvements

The API Manager UI supports OAS3 `response.content.schemes`.

* The OAS3 multiple back-ends are rendered on the screen, which allows users to select the required URL
* The UI has been extended to include all response codes available in OAS3
* Multipart request bodies are rendered in the back-end UI
* The UI allows users to define `allOf` response types for Swagger 2
* The `DataTypes` in API Manager have been changed to align with the OAS3 data types
* Users have the option to modify all back-end APIs without cloning

### Traffic monitor externalization showcase

An example dashboard for Elasticsearch leverages existing capabilities to output traffic monitor data using the open logging functionality and showcases this capability.

Easy to integrate with and to set up, [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack) enables you to extend your analytics needs using easy customization options.

The showcase provides a HTML version of the Traffic Monitor dashboard to visualize data, while demonstrating how you can leverage ELK to increase performance and storage capacity.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}
This showcase is not for use in a production environment. It is designed to run locally alongside a running API Gateway for demo purposes. Auto scaling in a multi-node environment requires custom configuration of Elasticsearch indexes.

### Multi organization beta

A new beta version (1.4) version of the following APIs are shipped with this release.

* The `user` API facilitates the GET, POST, UPDATE and DELETE of additional organizations and roles.
* The `currentuser` API is used by API Manager and returns the organizations and role information as part of a validation check.
* The `apirepo` API encapsulates all of the actions that can be performed to manage a back-end API in API Manager. You can pass in an `organizationId={uuid}` to filter by organization, or specify no `{uuid}` to return all of the back-end APIs for all organizations that the user is a member of.
* The `discovery` API manages all APIs in the API Catalog and all virtualized front-end APIs. This API also provides the ability to return all APIs associated with a user, or to filter by an `organizationId={uuid}`.

These APIs manage two new variables, the `orgs2Role` and `orgs2Name` maps. The user is still assigned to a primary organization as in earlier versions, however, the new variables store additional organizations and the user's role within each organization.

The beta 1.4 version of the APIs are generated in OAS3 format and published on the [swagger-ui page](http://apidocs.axway.com/swagger-ui/index.html).

To enable the 1.4 beta APIs in Policy Studio, browse to the `API Portal v1.4` Servlet and set the `com.axway.portal.servlet.disabled` flag to false.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}
Do not enable this flag on a production environment. Use these APIs only in test environments. Feedback on the implementation is welcome.

## Important changes

<!-- Use this section to describe any changes in the behavior of the product (as a result of features or fixes), for example, new Java system properties in the jvm.xml file. This section could also be used for any important information that doesn't fit elsewhere. -->

### Increased validation of WSDLs

In this release the xerces library has been updated to `xerces 2.12.0`. This library enforces stricter rules when validating malformed schemas. This means that some WSDLs that were previously imported successfully by API Manager might not import successfully in this version.

To suppress schema validation errors and relax the stricter validation of XML files a new flag `-DwsdlImport.suppressSchemaValidationErrors` is available in the `policystudio.ini` file. Set this flag to `true` if required. The default value is `false`.

### Filebeat v6.2.2

Filebeat has been updated to use v6.2.2. When installing Filebeat, follow the [official Filebeat documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/6.6/index.html).

### /users endpoint increased validation 
In current versions of the product /users API returns a list of all the users in an org. This endpoint was used to allow user share an application with other users in their organisation. This was identified as a security risk by our internal security team. While it was acceptable for both 'OrgAdmin' and 'APIAdmin' roles to return a list of users it was deemed that giving the 'User' was a security risk. For this reason we have removed the ability for 'Users' to view all other usernames in the org. This change may break some use cases for API Manager and API Portal. To reduce the impact of this change we allow customers to relax this restriction using a configuration flag.

The flag can be set in the 'jvm.xml' file (it does not exists by default) under 'groups/group-x/instance-y/conf' 

'<ConfigurationFragment>
    <VMArg name="-DAPIGW_TOGGLE_FEATURE_GET_ALL_USERS=true" />
</ConfigurationFragment>'

Alternatively it can be set as an 

## Limitations of this release

<!-- Add any limitations here -->

## Deprecated features

<!-- Add features that are deprecated here -->

As part of our software development life cycle we constantly review our API Management offering.

The following capabilities have been deprecated:

* API Gateway already supports the industry standard Internet Content Adaption Protocol (ICAP), so from the November 2020 release we will remove the existing embedded Anti-Virus scanners:
    * McAfee
    * Sophos
    * Clam AV

    Content scanning is still supported using the ICAP filter, which provides out-of-the-box integration with ICAP-capable servers provided by Symantec, McAfee, OPSWAT and others, promoting ease of deployment and operational control.

## Removed features

<!-- Add features that are removed here -->

To stay current and align our offerings with customer demand and best practices, Axway might discontinue support for some capabilities.

As part of this review, the following capabilities have been removed:

* API Tester - For testing APIs, it is recommended to use alternative tools, such as Postman, SoapUI, or API Fortress.
* RAML support - RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) support has been removed in favour of widely-adopted standards like Swagger and OpenAPI 3.
* The functionality to export back-end APIs converts all API formats to Swagger 1. With the introduction of OAS3, API Manager uses the `io.swagger.parser.v3.swagger-parser-v3:2.0.16` and `io.swagger.swagger-parser:1.0.48` libraries during the import process. This means that the export of back-end APIs is not supported for OAS3 or WSDL APIs, as this functionality relied on custom code in the old parser that is no longer available.
