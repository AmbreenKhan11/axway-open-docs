"description": "The **LDAP RBAC**\\nfilter combines Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This filter enables you to authorize a backend service based on user roles stored using LDAP. You can use the **LDAP RBAC**\\nfilter to read an attribute from LDAP, and compare it against some known values (for example, if `role`\\ncontains `engineering`, authorize the user). This filter combines functionality available in the **Retrieve from Directory Server**\\nand **Compare Attribute** filters. "
