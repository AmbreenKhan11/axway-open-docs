"description": "The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) filter enables you to configure the API Gateway to act as a PEP. The API Gateway intercepts a user request to a resource, and enforces the decision from the Policy Decision Point (PDP). The API Gateway queries the PDP to see if the user has access to the resource, and depending on the PDP response, allows the filter to pass or fail. Possible PDP responses include `Permit`, `Deny`, `NotApplicable`, and `Indeterminate`. "
