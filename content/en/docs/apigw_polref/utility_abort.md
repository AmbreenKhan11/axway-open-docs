Overview
--------

You can use the **Abort**
filter to force a policy to throw an exception. You can use it to test the behavior of the policy when an exception occurs.

For example, to quickly test how the policy behaves when a **Message Size**
filter throws an exception, you can place an **Abort**
filter before it in the policy. The following policy diagram illustrates this:
