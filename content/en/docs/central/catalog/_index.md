The AMPLIFY Central and Catalog work together to help customers to have a common place to import their APIs from all of their distributed API gateways throughout their enterprise.

The AMPLIFY Catalog provides a common view of all endpoints belonging to an organization. It enables more sophisticated integration ﬂows combining cloud and public on-premise APIs together. Alongside API interfaces, you can find Managed File Transfer (MFT) and B2B connectors that move data across your enterprise and outside its boundaries. The endpoints in the catalog can be in different environments such as in the cloud, on-premise, within a microservice mesh, or at the edge (DMZ) of the organization.

AMPLIFY Catalog allows developers to discover and understand the endpoints and protocols that they can use to integrate quickly with your services. It simplifies access and increases the speed of building, integrating, and deploying new services and apps. Platform administrators can limit content access to specific users or teams and manage subscriptions.
