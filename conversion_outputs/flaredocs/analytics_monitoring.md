API Gateway Analytics monitors, records, and reports on the history of message traffic between API Gateway instances and various services, remote hosts, and clients running in an API Gateway domain.

You can use API Gateway Analytics to monitor traffic and perform root cause analysis at the level of the domain, API Gateway instance, service, remote host, and client. You can also filter the display based on any selected time period. For example, this defaults to the last 7 days, but you can specify any date range.

</div>

<div>

{{&lt; alert title="Tip" color="primary" &gt;}}API Gateway Analytics produces reports based on metrics stored by API Gateway when processing messages. To produce a graph showing the number of connections made by API Gateway to a service, you must first configure a policy that routes messages to that service. When this policy is configured, send messages through the policy so they are routed to the target service. {{&lt; /alert &gt;}}
For details on configuring policies, see the [API Gateway Policy Developer Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_PolicyDevGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/) .

------------------

The **Transaction Audit Log** view enables you to filter the transaction audit log messages messages generated by API Gateway instances in your domain. For example:

![Transaction Audit Log](/Images/docbook/images/admin/analytics_transaction_audit.png)

You can filter the log messages by clicking the **Search** button on the right in the toolbar. The **Query Editor** dialog enables you to create a query to filter log messages by details such as time period, severity level, filter type or name, and message text. When you have added your search criteria, click **Search** at the bottom to run the query. You can also save the query for later use.

When you click **Search**, the log messages that match the search criteria specified in the query are displayed in the table. For example, the details displayed in the table include the log message text, API Gateway name, alerts, and time. You can also double-click an item in the list for more details (for example, transaction ID, filter category, and filter name).

{{&lt; alert title="Note" color="primary" &gt;}}To view data in the **Transaction Audit Log** tab, you must configure the API Gateway to write to the metrics database. In the Policy Studio tree, select **Environment Configuration** &gt; **Server Settings** &gt; **Logging** &gt; **Transaction Audit Log** &gt; **Database**. For more details, see the [Configure API Gateway logging and events](/csh?context=108&product=prod-api-gateway-77) in the [API Gateway Administrator Guide](/bundle/APIGateway_77_AdministratorGuide_allOS_en_HTML5/) .{{&lt; /alert &gt;}}

</div>

<div id="p_reporter_userguide_reports">

Schedule custom reports
-----------------------

API Gateway Analytics uses message metrics stored in a centralized metrics database by the Node Managers running in your domain. The Node Managers store metrics for the virtualized services exposed by the local API Gateway instances, and for the services, clients, and remote host connections that they protect.

API Gateway Analytics can generate usage reports and charts based on the stored metrics data, and enables you to configure custom reports to suit the needs of your environment. This includes viewing available metrics for each target report type, grouping and filtering metrics, and what to display on drill through.

### Enable scheduled reporting

You must fensure that reporting is enabled in Policy Studio. For details, see [Configure scheduled report settings in Policy StudioScheduled report storage settings](analytics_scheduled_reports.htm).

<div>

### Create reports in a monitoring view

In API Gateway Analytics, in the **System**, **API Services**, **Remote Hosts**, and **Protocols** views, you can create reports by clicking **Schedule** on the right in the toolbar. For example, to generate reports on API Service clients, perform the following steps:

1.  Click the **API Services** &gt; **Clients** view.
2.  Click **Edit** on the right in the toolbar to specify the report settings:
    -   **Name**: Defaults to the tab name (for example, **Clients**).
    -   **Group by**: Select how the report is displayed (for example, by **Client Name**, **Instance Name**, and so on). You can also select the metrics that are displayed (for example, **Messages**, **Successes**, and so on).
    -   **Filter by**: Select condition options to filter the display (for example, only show entries with a specific **Client Name**).
    -   **Enable drill-down**: Select this to use the value of the **Group by** columns to provide an additional drill-down report. You can choose to group by additional fields. This is enabled by default.
3.  These filtering and grouping mechanisms enable you to answer questions such as what clients used an API Service, or which API services were used by a client. For example, to show clients that used `Service1` , you can create a custom report that groups by **Client Name** and filters where **Service Name** is `Service1`.

The group-by mechanism only applies to the data table below the report chart. The chart remains the same.

1.  Click **Save** in the toolbar.
2.  Click **Schedule** in the toolbar.
3.  You can also click the **PDF** button in the toolbar to generate a PDF version of the report.

You can follow a similar sequence of steps to generate reports in the **System**, **Remote Hosts**, and **Protocols** views.

</div>

<div id="p_reporter_userguide_custom">

### Using the reports view

Alternatively, you can create a report in the **Reports** view. Perform the following steps:

1.  Click **New report** on the left in the toolbar.
2.  Enter the report **Name** in the dialog.
3.  Select the report **Type**, and click **OK**.
4.  Configure the schedule and output options on the right as appropriate.Defaults to PDF output daily at 9am, starting from today.
5.  Click **Apply** to save your settings.
6.  Click **Create** to create the report.

The following example shows a custom report grouped by **Service Name**:

![Custom Report](/Images/docbook/images/admin/analytics_reports_custom.png)

When you have created a report, you can select it in list on the **Managing Reports** page, and click **Generate now**. Alternatively, click **Delete** to remove the report from the list.
