Overview
--------

You can use the **HTTP Redirect**
filter to enable API Gateway to send an HTTP redirect message. For example, you can send an HTTP redirect to force a client to enter user credentials on an HTML login page if no HTTP cookie already exists. Alternatively, you can send an HTTP redirect if a web page has moved to a new URL address.
