| RDAPI-15638 | 1033180                                           | **Issue**:  UTF-8 characters printed in trace log are not displayed correctly in API Gateway Manager UI.     **Resolution**: Characters are now correctly encoded by Traffic Monitor REST API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| RDAPI-15642 | 1020707                                           | **Issue**:  When a Multipart Content Type is used in the Email Alert filter, the policy  completes but the email is not sent and an exception is written in the trace  logs.     **Resolution**: Selecting any Multipart Content Type in the Email Alert filter sends the email successfully.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| RDAPI-15659 | 1024906                                           | **Issue**:  API Manager does not allow special characters `.` and `~` in the name of a parameter,  although these are allowed by the Swagger definition.     **Resolution**: API Manager now allows `.` and `~` in the parameter name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| RDAPI-15668 | 1028025                                           | **Issue**:  When importing a project in Policy Studio, if a project is selected before browsing, the file browser window opens on a list of most recent projects instead of  the location of the specified project. **Resolution**: When a project is chosen, the browser window opens on the location of that project, otherwise it opens in the root project location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| RDAPI-15708 | 1023688                                           | **Issue**:  When a global fault handler is defined in API Manager, if a request arrives on an existing path/method but with a verb that is not handled, the Global Fault  Handler does not receive the `http.response.info` nor `http.response.status` attribute.     **Resolution**: When a global fault handler is defined in API Manager, the  response status is always accessible from the fault handler.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| RDAPI-15790 | 1023059                                           | **Issue**:  Checks on Application that all the APIs are accessible for assigned  Organization are triggered during Organization refresh and causing unexpected  dialog "Inconsistent API".     **Resolution**: UI is fixed to not trigger the checks on Application during  Organization refresh and the unwanted "Inconsistent API" dialog is  not shown as a result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The policy message attribute supersedes  the Java system property.     The following digest algorithms are supported: sha1, sha224, sha256,  sha384, and sha512. The corresponding SMIME Content-Type header `micalg`  attribute is set accordingly. |

| RDAPI-17904 | 1090822                                           | **Issue**:  API Gateway doesn't check OA Authz codes' expiry times when stored in an SQL  DB.

| RDAPI-18038 | 01094555,  01094399                               | **Issue**:  API Manager startup time slows down considerably in HA environments when the  number of organizations increase.     **Resolution**: Organizations are cached in memory so the calls to DB are  reduced.
